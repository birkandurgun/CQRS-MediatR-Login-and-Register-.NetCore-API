# CQRSandMediatR

This application is designed as a basic CQRS structure with authentication, registration and verification of email workflows using MediatR commands. The system implements secure password hashing. JWT tokens are generated for authentication, with refresh tokens for extended user sessions. Fluent validation library is used to control user inputs.
